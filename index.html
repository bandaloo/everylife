    <h1>Every Game of Life</h1>
    <p>
      Conway's Game of Life is one of many cellular automata that have rules
      based on neighbors. If you generalize it, there are 262144 similar games.
      Check the table in the top left corner of this web toy I made
      <a href="https://www.bandaloo.fun/golm/">here</a>. Each pixel on this grid
      corresponds to one of those rulesets and starts off empty. I couldn't find
      if anybody had done this before and I wanted to see what it looked like. I
      think it's pretty interesting! (It's pretty slow; I threw this together in
      under an hour.) Also, it's toroidal so cells at the edges are actually
      neighbors with the opposite edge.
